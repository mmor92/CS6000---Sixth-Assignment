\section{Report}

%Describe your learning/process so far on the survey paper.  I expect this to be short. 
During this week, Bill and I have been focusing on the story-telling part of the paper. We have decided to organize things a little bit different. We think that with this new organization, we will have the 'OSCAR' structure that we discussed in class. We have also established what we have left and what each one of us will do in the final paper. For now, we have also decided to use figures from other papers. This will save us time and if needed we could just create new figures in the future. Finally we have discussed the timeline to submit the final paper.

On Monday we will have a meeting and discuss the comments that Dr. Boult has made in the survey paper. 

Inside my repo I have cloned the overleaf project. In this folder you can find all the files for the tex file.
